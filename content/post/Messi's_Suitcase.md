> 犹记上一次搭建博客第一篇文章敲了`Hernán Casciari`写的 *Messi is a dog* 英译版，那会小梅还在生涯最低谷的时候。一转眼现在已经2023年了，那个梦幻的夜晚也已经过去一个多月了，新博客没想好写点什么，就同样用`Hernán Casciari`的文章开个头，庆祝这个童话的结尾。

On Saturday mornings in 2003, Catalonia's TV3 was broadcasting live the matches of Barça’s youth teams. And in the chats of Argentine emigrants, two questions were frequently asked: how to make *dulce de leche* by boiling cans of condensed milk, and at what time the fifteen-year-old boy from Rosario who socred goals in every game played.

In the 2003-2004 season, Linoel Messi played thirty-seven matches and scored thirty-five goals: the morning rating on Catalan TV on Saturdays was higher than at night. People were already talking about *aquest nen* in the hairdressers, in the bars, and in the stands of Camp Nou.

The only one who didn't talk was him: in the post-match interviews, the teenager answered all the questions with a *yes*, *no* or *thank you*, and then looked down. We Argentine emigrants would have preferred a chatty guy, but here was a good thing: when he put together a sentence, he swallowed the s's and said: *ful* instead of *falta*.

Time began to pass. Messi became the undisputed 10 of Barça. The Leagues, the King's Cups, and the Champions League came. And both he and us, the immigrants, knew that the accent was the hardest thing to hold on to.

It was hard for us all to keep saying *gambeta* instead of regate, but all the same time, we knew that it was our final trench. And Messi was our leader in that battle. The kid who didn't talk kept our way of talking alive.

So, all of a sudden we were not only enjoying the best player we had ever seen, but we were also monitoring him to make sure he didn't slip a Spanish slang in interviews.

In addition to his goals, we celebrated that, in the locker rooms
